ShadowWolf 
==========
<img src="http://notionparallax.co.uk/img/Shadow_wolf_logo.png" align="right" >

A mini ERP type app to capture people, projects and their relationships.

It is being built in house at [BVN DH](https://bvn.com.au) as a way to pull together all our data sources. 

It is written for architecture practices, but might be aplicable/portable to other fields.

If you'd like to get involved in the process we'd love that! 

The name comes from another [group of trackers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Wolves).

## Demo ##
You can see a live version, with dummy data [here](http://notionparallax.co.uk/ShadowWolf/client/dist/index.html#/people)

## Getting involved ##
We're probably not ready for anyone to get involved in a big way as we're changing too much stuff, but if there are any features that you would like to see, or bugs that you think we should fix, then feel free to open an issue.

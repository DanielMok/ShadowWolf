A mini ERP type app to capture people, projects and their relationships.

It is being built in house at [BVN DH](https://bvn.com.au) as a way to pull together all our data sources. 

It is written for architecture practices, but might be aplicable/portable to other fields.

If you'd like to get involved in the process we'd love that!

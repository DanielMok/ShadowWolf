<h2>Location</h2>
<p class="explantory-text">This is a way of finding the address of the project, also where the front door is, and eventually a nice boundary drawing too. This will eventually feed to the public website so that people can find the projects.</p>
<p class="explantory-text">The addresses were preloaded by <a href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2013/09/24/artificial-artificial-intelligence/">Mechanical turks</a>. As people with domain knowledge, your job is to collate their attempts into one canonical address/location box. Once there is a good address for this project we'll remove the others.</p>

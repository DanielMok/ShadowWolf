<h2>Key Dimensions</h2>
<p class="explantory-text">How big is this project? This might seem childish, but really it's important for us to be able to classify things by size. Submissions often ask for evidence of projects in certain size ranges, so being able to search for this rather than just guess is important.</p>
<p class="explantory-text">Some of these fields need numbers. Don't put in thousant separators or units, we'll handle all of that for you.</p>

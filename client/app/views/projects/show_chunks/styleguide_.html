<h2>Styleguide</h2>
<p class="explantory-text">So that all our project sheets look the same and read as if they are written with one voice here's some guidelines.</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>As a base we use the Economist style guide. Variations from that are detailed below.</p>
<h3>Measurements</h3>
<p>All measurements are to be in SI units or SI derivatives.</p>
<p>Areas are in m&sup2; not M&sup2;, M2, m2, sqm, sq.m etc.</p>
<p>loads more stylistic ranting to come here!</p>
<h2>Spacing</h2>
<p>All multiple spaces will be colapsed to single spaces by the browser, but for consistency, single space after full stops.</p>
<p>Don't add in empty lines between paragraphs. Extra spacing around paragraphs will be provided by the styling at 
presentation time and will be adjustable. If you do put in an extra line then that will throw off the spacing of the 
paragraphs in a way that we won't be able to fix.</p>

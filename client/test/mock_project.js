    "description": "New draft text available in W Drive, _,Lavarack Barracks is located on a 400 hectare site immediately to the south of the city of Townsville. The Barracks is home to one of the Australian Army's Brigades and a number of supporting Units. Stage 3 of the Barracks Redevelopment has been carried out in accordance with the 1999 Redevelopment Masterplan. This Masterplan was partially enacted in the critically acclaimed Stage 2 Redevelopment and Stage 3 continues that work. Bligh Voller Nield has played a significant architectural role in both Stages of the Project.,The Stage 3 Project includes new Working Accommodation. Careful design and implementation of an architectural expression and character appropriate to the function of the facilities has been developed and appropriately synthesised with the landscape and the internal and external context to provide the physical matrix and background to tropical Australian Army life. ,The recent redevelopment projects have made a significant contribution to the new identity of Lavarack Barracks and its future in Northern Australia. The architectural and urban design solutions developed for the Project define Lavarack Barracks as a place of significance within Defence and the broader community. As well, the redevelopment has been seen by Defence as a benchmark of excellence in the provision of facilities for working accommodation.",
